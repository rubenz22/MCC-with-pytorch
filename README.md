# MCC-with-pytorch
Multiclass Classification with Pytorch. I use Iris dataset from sklearn. Input layer 4 neurons, hidden layer 6 neurons and output layer 3 neurons. I add callback and early stopping function not only to prevent overfitting but also to reduce computation time. I no longer define the number of epochs. Let the algorithm find itself.
